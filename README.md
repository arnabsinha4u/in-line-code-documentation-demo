# In-line code documentation demo for DevOps Days Amsterdam, 2017
This repository has 4 branches:
* master - Baseline
* documentation_improvement_1 - Documentation improved in only one Javascript code thus partial improvement in Documentation coverage and maturity status but build breaks due to non-compliance of Documentation vs Code ratio
* documentation_improvement_2 - Documentation improved in two more Javascripts thus better improvement reported in Documentation coverage and maturity status but build breaks due to non-compliance of Documentation vs Code ratio
* documentation_improvement_3 - Documentation improved further one left over Javascript which is reflected in the Documentation coverage and maturity status and the build also passes as Documentation vs Code ratio is achieved
