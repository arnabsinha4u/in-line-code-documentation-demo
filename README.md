# In-line code documentation demo for DevOps Days Amsterdam, 2017
This repository has 4 branches:
* ***master*** - Baseline for the demo
* documentation_improvement_1
  - Documentation improved in only one Javascript (fibonacci_generic.js) thus partial improvement in Documentation coverage and maturity status
  - Build breaks due to non-compliance of Documentation vs Code ratio
* documentation_improvement_2
  - Documentation improved in two more Javascripts (fibonacci_recursive.js & tower_of_hanoi_generic.js) thus improvement reported in Documentation coverage and maturity status
  - Build still breaks due to non-compliance of Documentation vs Code ratio
* documentation_improvement_3
  - Documentation improved further one final Javascript (tower_of_hanoi_recursive.js) which is reflected in the Documentation coverage as complete and high maturity status
  - Build also passes as Documentation vs Code ratio is achieved
